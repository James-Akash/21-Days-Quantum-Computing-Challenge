## Day 06 – Dirac Notation & Hilbert Spaces & Expert Session

**Topic Details:**  
Today’s focus was on **Dirac notation** (also called *bra-ket notation*) and the idea of **Hilbert spaces**.  

- **Dirac Notation (Bra-Ket):** In quantum mechanics, states of a system are written in a very compact way. A “ket” like |ψ⟩ represents a quantum state (think of it as a column vector), while a “bra” like ⟨ψ| represents its mirror version (a row vector). When you put a bra and a ket together (⟨φ|ψ⟩), you get the inner product, which tells you how similar two states are.  
- **Hilbert Spaces:** These are the mathematical “universes” where quantum states live. Imagine a space where every possible state of a qubit can be described as a vector. Basis states (like |0⟩ and |1⟩ for a qubit) act like the building blocks — just like how any location in a city can be described using street coordinates, any quantum state can be described using these basis vectors.  
- **Operators:** These are special mathematical objects that act on states to change them or extract information. For example, Hermitian operators represent measurable quantities in quantum mechanics, such as energy or spin.  

**📝Reflection:**  
I realized that Dirac notation is not just a fancy symbol—it’s a universal language that makes quantum mechanics less messy. Understanding Hilbert spaces and basis states gives me a clear picture of how qubits and quantum operations are built from the ground up.
