## Day 05 – Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing

**Topic Details:**  
Today’s focus was on key linear algebra concepts that form the backbone of quantum computing: **tensor products, inner/outer products, and unitary matrices**.  

- **Tensor Products:** In quantum computing, we often deal with multiple qubits at once. A tensor product is the mathematical way of combining two or more qubits into a larger system. For example, if one qubit can be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩, and another can also be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, then together they form a 4-dimensional space with states like |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩. This idea scales up to many qubits, allowing us to represent complex quantum systems.  
- **Inner Products:** The inner product (⟨φ|ψ⟩) is a way of measuring how similar two states are. If the result is 1, they are identical; if 0, they are completely different (orthogonal). This is important because it helps define probabilities in quantum mechanics.  
- **Outer Products:** The outer product (|ψ⟩⟨φ|) produces an operator, not just a number. Outer products are useful for constructing projection operators that “pick out” certain states from a quantum system.  
- **Unitary Matrices:** Quantum gates are represented by unitary matrices. These matrices have a special property: they preserve the length of vectors, which means they preserve probabilities. This is crucial because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must always equal 1.  

**Reflection:**  
Learning about tensor products opened my eyes to how quantum systems scale so rapidly — adding just one more qubit doubles the size of the space. It made me appreciate why quantum computers are so powerful, as they can represent an enormous amount of information compared to classical systems.  

The concepts of inner and outer products showed me how linear algebra translates directly into the “language” of quantum probabilities and operations. I found it fascinating that the inner product tells us about overlap and likelihood, while the outer product creates operators that actively shape the system.  

Finally, understanding unitary matrices helped me see why quantum gates are fundamentally different from classical logic gates. They don’t just flip bits but rotate and transform quantum states in a way that always preserves the overall probability.  

Overall, today’s session strengthened my understanding of how **linear algebra is the mathematical foundation of quantum computing**, and why it’s impossible to understand qubits and gates without it.

## Day 06 – Dirac Notation & Hilbert Spaces & Expert Session

**Topic Details:**  
Today’s focus was on **Dirac notation** (also called *bra-ket notation*) and the idea of **Hilbert spaces**.  

- **Dirac Notation (Bra-Ket):** In quantum mechanics, states of a system are written in a very compact way. A “ket” like |ψ⟩ represents a quantum state (think of it as a column vector), while a “bra” like ⟨ψ| represents its mirror version (a row vector). When you put a bra and a ket together (⟨φ|ψ⟩), you get the inner product, which tells you how similar two states are.  
- **Hilbert Spaces:** These are the mathematical “universes” where quantum states live. Imagine a space where every possible state of a qubit can be described as a vector. Basis states (like |0⟩ and |1⟩ for a qubit) act like the building blocks — just like how any location in a city can be described using street coordinates, any quantum state can be described using these basis vectors.  
- **Operators:** These are special mathematical objects that act on states to change them or extract information. For example, Hermitian operators represent measurable quantities in quantum mechanics, such as energy or spin.  

**📝Reflection:**  
What stood out to me today is how **Dirac notation simplifies the complexity of quantum mechanics**. Instead of juggling long equations, I can think in terms of bras and kets that directly represent states and their relationships. This notation is not just a shorthand but a **new way of thinking**, where mathematics and physics blend together seamlessly.  

Understanding Hilbert spaces also gave me a deeper appreciation of how qubits are structured — they aren’t just “0” and “1” but exist in a whole space of possibilities. It makes me realize that the strength of quantum computing lies in this ability to use superpositions of basis states. Finally, learning about operators showed me how the abstract math actually connects to real, measurable properties of physical systems.  

Overall, this session helped me see the **foundation on which qubits, gates, and measurements are built**, and why quantum mechanics needs its own language to truly make sense.
