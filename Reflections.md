## Day 05 – Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing

**Topic Details:**  
Today’s focus was on key linear algebra concepts that form the backbone of quantum computing: **tensor products, inner/outer products, and unitary matrices**.  

- **Tensor Products:** In quantum computing, we often deal with multiple qubits at once. A tensor product is the mathematical way of combining two or more qubits into a larger system. For example, if one qubit can be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩, and another can also be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, then together they form a 4-dimensional space with states like |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩. This idea scales up to many qubits, allowing us to represent complex quantum systems.  
- **Inner Products:** The inner product (⟨φ|ψ⟩) is a way of measuring how similar two states are. If the result is 1, they are identical; if 0, they are completely different (orthogonal). This is important because it helps define probabilities in quantum mechanics.  
- **Outer Products:** The outer product (|ψ⟩⟨φ|) produces an operator, not just a number. Outer products are useful for constructing projection operators that “pick out” certain states from a quantum system.  
- **Unitary Matrices:** Quantum gates are represented by unitary matrices. These matrices have a special property: they preserve the length of vectors, which means they preserve probabilities. This is crucial because in quantum mechanics, the total probability must always equal 1.  

**Reflection:**  
Learning about tensor products opened my eyes to how quantum systems scale so rapidly — adding just one more qubit doubles the size of the space. It made me appreciate why quantum computers are so powerful, as they can represent an enormous amount of information compared to classical systems.  

The concepts of inner and outer products showed me how linear algebra translates directly into the “language” of quantum probabilities and operations. I found it fascinating that the inner product tells us about overlap and likelihood, while the outer product creates operators that actively shape the system.  

Finally, understanding unitary matrices helped me see why quantum gates are fundamentally different from classical logic gates. They don’t just flip bits but rotate and transform quantum states in a way that always preserves the overall probability.  

Overall, today’s session strengthened my understanding of how **linear algebra is the mathematical foundation of quantum computing**, and why it’s impossible to understand qubits and gates without it.

## Day 06 – Dirac Notation & Hilbert Spaces & Expert Session

**Topic Details:**  
Today’s focus was on **Dirac notation** (also called *bra-ket notation*) and the idea of **Hilbert spaces**.  

- **Dirac Notation (Bra-Ket):** In quantum mechanics, states of a system are written in a very compact way. A “ket” like |ψ⟩ represents a quantum state (think of it as a column vector), while a “bra” like ⟨ψ| represents its mirror version (a row vector). When you put a bra and a ket together (⟨φ|ψ⟩), you get the inner product, which tells you how similar two states are.  
- **Hilbert Spaces:** These are the mathematical “universes” where quantum states live. Imagine a space where every possible state of a qubit can be described as a vector. Basis states (like |0⟩ and |1⟩ for a qubit) act like the building blocks — just like how any location in a city can be described using street coordinates, any quantum state can be described using these basis vectors.  
- **Operators:** These are special mathematical objects that act on states to change them or extract information. For example, Hermitian operators represent measurable quantities in quantum mechanics, such as energy or spin.  

**📝Reflection:**  
What stood out to me today is how **Dirac notation simplifies the complexity of quantum mechanics**. Instead of juggling long equations, I can think in terms of bras and kets that directly represent states and their relationships. This notation is not just a shorthand but a **new way of thinking**, where mathematics and physics blend together seamlessly.  

Understanding Hilbert spaces also gave me a deeper appreciation of how qubits are structured — they aren’t just “0” and “1” but exist in a whole space of possibilities. It makes me realize that the strength of quantum computing lies in this ability to use superpositions of basis states. Finally, learning about operators showed me how the abstract math actually connects to real, measurable properties of physical systems.  

Overall, this session helped me see the **foundation on which qubits, gates, and measurements are built**, and why quantum mechanics needs its own language to truly make sense.


## Day 07 – Quantum Mechanics Basics

**Topic Details:**  
- **Schrödinger Equation:** This is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics. It’s like Newton’s laws, but instead of predicting exact paths of particles, it describes how a particle’s *wave function* changes over time. The wave function (ψ) holds all the information about the system — such as the probabilities of finding a particle in different places. It shows that quantum systems evolve smoothly and deterministically until a measurement is made.  

- **Measurement in Quantum Mechanics:** Measurement in the quantum world is very different from the classical one. Before measurement, a system can exist in a *superposition* of states. Once you measure, the system “collapses” into a definite state, and you only see one outcome. The probability of each outcome is given by the square of the wave function (Born rule). In other words, measurement doesn’t just reveal reality — it *changes* it.  

- **Postulates of Quantum Mechanics:** These are the fundamental rules that all quantum systems follow:  
  1. Quantum states are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space.  
  2. Physical observables (like energy, momentum, spin) are represented by Hermitian operators.  
  3. The time evolution of a closed system is governed by the Schrödinger equation (unitary evolution).  
  4. Measurement outcomes are probabilistic, with probabilities given by the Born rule.  
  5. After measurement, the system collapses into the eigenstate corresponding to the observed result.  

**Reflection:**  
Today’s session gave me a clearer picture of the **fundamental framework of quantum mechanics**. The Schrödinger equation showed me how quantum systems evolve in a smooth and predictable way — but only until we actually measure them. At that point, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics takes over, and the wave function collapses into a single outcome.  

The postulates were especially helpful because they act like the “rulebook” of quantum mechanics. They connect the math (Hilbert spaces, operators) with the physical world (observables, measurements). My key insight is that measurement is not a passive act — it’s an *active process* that shapes the system itself. This dual nature of evolution (deterministic vs. probabilistic) is what makes quantum mechanics both strange and powerful, and it’s also what gives quantum computing its unique capabilities.

**Expert Session Reflection:**  
The expert lecture provided a broader **learning path and career perspective** in quantum computing. I learned that building a future in this field requires identifying the right **domain** (like finance, optimization, chemistry, or logistics) because quantum systems are designed for solving complex, exponential problems — not everyday computing tasks.  

The talk also highlighted the **interdisciplinary nature** of the field. Physicists, mathematicians, software engineers, and domain experts must all collaborate, and even if I specialize in one area, I need enough knowledge of the others to work effectively in a team.  

Another key takeaway was the **industry outlook**: we are still in the first generation of quantum computing (2018–2028), but by the 2030s it will likely be applied to real business and industrial use cases. Importantly, quantum computers will not replace classical ones but will complement them — **CPU + QPU** working together.  

This session reminded me to think long-term: building strong foundations now, learning practical tools like Qiskit, and keeping an eye on where industry opportunities are emerging. It motivated me to see this challenge as not just about learning concepts, but as an entry point into the growing quantum ecosystem.
